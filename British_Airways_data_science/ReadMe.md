#### Task 01: Web scraping to gain company insights 
Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business. The first task focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights to present the stakeholders for further decisions.
Data for British Airways was collected from Skytrax. The following insights were uncovered and summarized in the one-slide presentation.

#### Task 02 - Predicting customer buying behaviour
Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different from what it used to be. Airlines must be proactive in acquiring customers before they embark on their holidays. This task involves building a high-quality predictive model to predict successful bookings.
